# Learning Angular
I am learning Angular.js using this repository.


#### Note: Cross Origin Requests
Angular does not allow cross origin requests if we launch pages locally, by directly opening the html files. For this reason, we can run an http server on the app folder:

`sudo npm -g install http-server`
`sudo http-server path/to/app`
